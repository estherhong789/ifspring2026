        <h1>Introductory Questions & Responses</h1>
        
        <p>1. Provide your name, major, year in school (sophomore, junior, etc).</p>

        <p>a. I'm Esther Hong, a freshman studying Finance and Management and minoring in Communication Design.</p>

        <p>2. Tell us a bit about your background and what prompted you to take this class.</p>

        <p>a. I've always loved art, especially as a form of communication. I wanted to find a practical way to incorporate my art and design background, especially as I consider my career. I realized that learning a bit of coding, especially front-end, would be useful. I have absolutely no coding background but super excited!</p>

        <p>3. Do you have any experience with HTML/CSS/JS? If so, tell us a bit about it.</p>

        <p>a. I don't have any experience with any of those languages!</p>

        <p>4. Name one thing you hope to learn in this class.</p>

        <p>a. I hope to gain more coding knowledge, enough so that I would be able to code and design websites for individual projects I take on.</p>

        <p>5. Name one way you expect designing for screen to be different from designing for paper.</p>

        <p>a. Designing for screen compared to designing on paper is vastly different. Designing for screen allows for more user interaction and experience, having hyperlinks to different pages, changing of visuals as a cursor hovers over different features on a screen, etc. On the other hand, paper is more straightforward, needing mainly to worry about formatting all the information on one page in a legible and visually pleasing way.</p>

        <p>6. Provide a link to a website you think exemplifies effective design. Explain your choice.</p>

        <p>a. I love WITHIN's website. I think given that it's a digital marketing webite, their own website needs to show their credibilities: their creativity and dynamic design. There are plenty of moving visuals showing off their campaigns while not being too overwhelming or busy despite having text on top. It further presents their information in a logical way: show off successful brands they've worked with, then information on how to work with them. As they scrolled and elements unwrap, it's super visually pleasing while balancing their ability to clearly show the information potential clients and employees are looking for.</p>

        <p>7. Provide a link to a website you think exemplifies effective design. Explain your choice.</p>

        <p>a. Ritual pill's website I've always admired. Not only is it visually pleasing, but it playfully combines moving visuals with still visuals. I especially the page where they show the contents of the Synbiotic+ Gut Health pill, where as you scroll, the contents are shown, explained, and put together in a clean way, allowing potential customers to feel a bit more at ease about all of the clean ingredients used in their product while being dynamic and creative. </p>

        <p>8. Provide a link to a website you think exemplifies effective design. Explain your choice.</p>

        <p>a. Nike's website is a great example of effective design. Upon clicking on their website, the user is immediately immersed into the inspiring and smooth movement of Nike athletes. There are dynamic moving examples, athletic shots, and without having to scroll for too long, you're able to see their top products. I feel that Nike has a great example of how long users should need to scroll to start seeing products.</p>

        <p>Looks like we made it</p>
        <p>Look how far we've come, my baby</p>
        <p>We mighta took the long way</p>
        <p>We knew we'd get there someday</p>

        <br> 

        <p>They said, "I bet they'll never make it"</p>
        <p>But just look at us holding on</p>
        <p>We're still together, still going strong</p>

        <br> 

        <p>Mm you're still the one</p>
        <p>You're still the one I run to</p>
        <p>The one that I belong to</p>
        <p>You're still the one I want for life</p>
        <p>(You're still the one)</p>
        <p>You're still the one that I love</p>
        <p>The only one I dream of</p>
        <p>You're still the one I kiss goodnight</p>

        <br> 
        
        <p>Ain't nothin' better</p>
        <p>We beat the odds together</p>
        <p>I'm glad we didn't listen</p>
        <p>Look at what we would be missin'</p>

        <br>

        <p>They said, "I bet they'll never make it"</p>
